# CLASSIC SNAKE GAME

## Description:

Hello, World! This is my final project for the course CS50x by Harvardx. 

My inspiration comes from video-games. I started playing video-games at a young age, with the ATARI system and the first Nintendo console.
In this project I have recreated one of my favorite games. Based on the first game I played on my first mobile phone: Snake.

A big thanks to the instructor Angela Yu from The London APP Brewery for providing me with all the basic knowledge about Python programming. She has been my mentor, and provided me with the building blocks that made this project possible.

I used Python and its in-built libraries: 
* turtle
* tkinter 
* sqlite3 
* time
* random
* datetime

I practiced using Object Oriented Programming to make a Snake class using turtles to add up segments. Next, a Food class which is a single turtle jumping randomly across the screen. Finally, a Scoreboard class that uses an invisible turtle to write the score on the screen.

After the basic logic of the game was implemented, I decided to interact with the player(s) using tkinter's simple dialogs. This way I can know the name of the player and if he wants to continue playing after a game session is over.

To store this data I used Python's sqlite3. The project is able to successfully CRUD data. Many bugs and issues have been addressed thanks to the help of Google, Stackoverflow, but mostly the print() function and my perseverance.

At the end of the game, I implemented a tkinter canvas to display the top 3 players with their highest scores.

In the future I plan to further improve the design. I have been reading about how to embed the turtle module inside a Tkinter canvas. This would allow me to include control buttons and other features that improve the user experience.

A special thanks to the instructors David J. Malan and Doug Lloyd, whom I learned so much from.
